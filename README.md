The world of Pokemon GO is as big as our planet. Pokemons have been sighted on top of cliffs perched over oceans as well as in your next door coffee shop. We would like to create a world-wide interactive map that shows where Pokemons were predicted to appear. Each pokemon prediction you add to the map should have all relevant information including name, time the pokemon is predicted to appear, prediction confidence rate etc. The map should be filtered by a time range (i.e predicted to appear in the next day) as well as pokemon name and pokemon specie.
